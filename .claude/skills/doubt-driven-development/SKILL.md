# Skill: doubt-driven-development

Subjects non-trivial decisions to adversarial review before they stand.
"A confident answer is not a correct one."

---

## When to use

Invoke `/doubt` when:

- A decision introduces branching logic or crosses a service boundary
- Correctness depends on something you cannot directly verify (thread safety,
  idempotency, access control enforcement, lock ordering)
- The change is irreversible or touches a security/data boundary
- You are about to commit a fix to a hardening or correctness issue

Skip for mechanical operations: renaming, formatting, config value changes.

---

## Process

### 1. CLAIM — name the decision

State in 2–3 lines:

- What you are doing
- What correctness means here
- What breaks if you are wrong

### 2. EXTRACT — isolate the artifact

Pull out only the code/SQL/config being decided on.
Do NOT include your reasoning — pass artifact + contract only.

### 3. DOUBT — adversarial review

Invoke a fresh-context subagent with:

```
Here is an artifact and its contract. Your job is to find flaws.
Do not validate — actively try to break it.

Contract: [paste contract]
Artifact: [paste artifact]

Find: incorrect assumptions, missing edge cases, ways the contract is violated.
```

Withhold your original claim entirely. If you hand over conclusions,
you get back validation of your conclusions.

### 4. RECONCILE — classify findings

For each finding from the reviewer:

- **Contract misread** — reviewer misunderstood the invariant → clarify and re-run
- **Actionable** → fix before committing
- **Trade-off** → document in a comment or BLOCKERS.md, proceed
- **Noise** → discard

### 5. STOP

Stop when: all findings are trade-offs or noise, OR 3 cycles complete, OR explicitly
told to ship.

## Cross-model escalation

In interactive sessions, offer the user a choice between single-model and cross-model
review for the highest-stakes decisions (access-control changes, auth changes, schema migrations).

---

## Good defaults

Run `/doubt` before committing any fix to:

- Access-control or data-scoping logic (isolation guarantees)
- Append-only or otherwise ordering-sensitive writes (invariant preservation)
- Execution logic with recursion or retry limits (recursion cap, circuit breaker)
- Auth middleware (session handling, role claims)
